shellll: LLL, in the shell!
====

The world's first (and probably last) pure-bash implementation of the LLL algorithm. Announced at the Crypto 2022 rump session.

Implementation in progress -- contributors welcome! Currently, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is working (aside from overflow issues), and Babai's nearest plane algorithm is almost done.

lll.sh is released into the public domain -- everyone is welcome to use and enjoy the usability, readability, and maintainibility of this several-hundred-line shell script.
